Ann Treadwell (Anderson), a society dame, lusts for Shelby but has to tell him or he'd never know. And Detective McPherson develops a crush on the dead woman. There is an extraordinary scene where he enters her apartment at night, looks through her letters, touches her dresses, sniffs her perfume, pours himself a drink from her bottle and sits down beneath her enormous portrait, which is placed immodestly above her own fireplace.</description></item><item><title>Stefania Spampinato Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Parents, Actress, Glee, Net Worth, Movies and T</title><link>/stefania-spampinato-bio-wiki-age-height-husband-parents-actress-glee-net-worth-movies-and-tv-shows.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stefania-spampinato-bio-wiki-age-height-husband-parents-actress-glee-net-worth-movies-and-tv-shows.html</guid><description>Table of Contents
